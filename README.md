## Marco Montes de Oca

I am a bioinformatician with experience handling short-read data such as Illumina reads. My understanding of bash allows me to run
command-line tools in a fine-tuned way. My preferred data processing method involves using python scripts in combination with CSV 
or Excel files to summarise each step in user-friendly files. R is a versatile language to perform data analysis, and I use it as 
it is actively maintained. My background in biochemistry and molecular biology gives me a deeper interpretation of methods, 
analysis, and results.
